If you need to do a teleconference, please verify that the room you select has phone jacks and that it has a phone number assigned to it by clicking on the Room name and seeing its details. <i>Some of the rooms do not have phone jacks enabled or no phone jacks at all.</i>
You can show all the rooms that have enabled phone jacks by selecting "Telephone Jacks" in the "Availability Filters" section in the left and clicking Find Space.
  <br />
  <i><b>Most of the rooms do not have the teleconferencing phone in them, you have to request separately and in advance to SEAS Computing at <a href="mailto:help@seas.harvard.edu" style="font-weight: normal;">help@seas.harvard.edu</a>.</b></i>
