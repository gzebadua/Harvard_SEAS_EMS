<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pierce 301 Rules for Use:</span></strong>
<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
Scheduling:</span></strong>
<br />
<br />
Pierce 301 is a unique space that is in high demand for classes and events both within and outside of SEAS. The following prioritization model has been developed to ensure the best use of this space:
<br />
<ol>
<li>SEAS classes</li>
<li>SEAS sections</li>
<li>Teaching events</li>
<li>Non-teaching events</li>
</ol>
<br />
In general, non-SEAS events will not be scheduled in Pierce 301 until we have a better sense of SEAS needs. One-time non-SEAS events may be scheduled, depending on room availability, under the following conditions:<br />
<ul>
<li>One time non-SEAS events may not be scheduled more than three weeks in advance</li>
<li><strong>One time non-SEAS events may be bumped to accommodate SEAS events, typically with one week’s notice.</strong></li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use of Pierce 301:</span></strong>
<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>As a general rule, please clean up after yourselves and leave the room as you found it.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Feel free to reconfigure the room to your needs, but please put the furniture back in its original arrangement&nbsp;before you leave (a diagram will be posted in the room to illustrate the set up).</li>
<li>Please remove all course-related materials, all food and drink, trash, etc. from the room when you leave.</li>
<li>Please leave the whiteboards clean.</li>
</ul>
<br />
</li>
<li>All course-related material ought to be stored in the lockers in the anteroom or in space other than the main classroom.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Please discourage students from leaving projects (and/or materials related to projects) in Pierce 301 with "do not remove" signs. This room is occasionally used for events sponsored by the Dean (and sometimes by the President). We will alert all room users of such events.</li>
</ul>
<br />
</li>
<li>Please take care to minimize damage to walls and furniture. Recently, there was some damage to wall paint and furniture due to duct or electrical tape.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>If it is necessary to affix projects to walls and furniture, please use painters’ tape, which should mitigate such damage.</li>
<li>Please ask students to cover any surfaces when they are using glue  that is not water-based.
</li>
</ul>
<br />
</li>
</ol>
